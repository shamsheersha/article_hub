üî• State Management Explanation
Riverpod is used for managing the application's state.
The ArticleController (a StateNotifier) handles fetching articles, searching, and managing favorites.
The UI listens to the StateNotifierProvider and rebuilds reactively based on the state (loading, data, or error).
Riverpod ensures a scalable and testable codebase with clean separation of concerns.


‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Limitations
No pagination implemented yet (all articles are loaded at once).

The API fetching is not cached; new network calls are made on app launch and search.

Search queries re-fetch from API instead of searching locally on existing list (can be optimized).

No offline support for article listing (only favorites are saved offline).
